# Portfolio 2020 -Â https://gregoryalbouy.com

This is my portfolio, built from scratch upon my own [Webcomponents framework](https://github.com/gregoryalbouy/webcomponents-framework).  
I kept it dead simple since the latter is already a huge piece of work. I just needed a personnal space to exhibit my work.

## Features

- 100% Webcomponents
- Handcrafted routing logics
- Fetches Go + SQL API deployed on Google App Engine (previously Node.js + MongoDB)
- Project filters logic + animation
- Functional contact form
