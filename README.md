# Portfolio 2020 -Â https://gregoryalbouy.com

This is my portfolio, built from scratch upon my own [Webcomponents framework](https://github.com/gregoryalbouy/webcomponents-framework).  
I kept it dead simple since the latter is already a huge piece of work. I just needed a personnal space to exhibit my work.

## Features

- 100% Webcomponents
- Fetch Node.js API deployed on Google App Engine (repo coming!)
- Nice project filters
- Hand-crafted contact form

## Coming soon

- Presentation + CV
- Social links
